## Lecture 8a

What should you be aware of when using the rainbow colormap with plots? 

* All of these
 *  After the ROYGBIV colors are exhausted the colors will start repeating
 *  Certain colors, such as yellow, are hard to distinguish on some screens
 *  Our eyes tend to focus on colors that "pop", potentially biasing our
interpretation of the plot

## Lecture 8b

A scree plot displays eigenvalues associated with components or factors and can
help determine the number of factors that display most of the varaiability in a
given data set. Using the scree plot below, what is the ideal number of factors
for PCA from this data set?  
![Scree Plot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nsh87/hs616/master/figs/scree-plot-example.png) 

* 2
 *  1
 *  3
 *  40

## Lecture 9a

You create the plot below.  
![High Density Plot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nsh87/hs616/master/figs/high-density-plot.png)  
Realizing this display format does not tell you much about the data, you plot
the same data, this time creating the new plot below.  
![Smooth Scatter Plot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nsh87/hs616/master/figs/smoothscatter-of-high-density-plot.png)  
What can be said about this new plot? 

* It is a smooth scatter, or density plot, useful when a data set displays
overplotting
 *  It is a blurred scatter, useful when a data set displays overplotting
 *  It not considered a scatter or density plot at all
 *  It requires a special package in R to produce

## Lecture 9b

The following code generates the plot below:  
```R
g2 + geom_boxplot() + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=50, size=20, vjust=0.5))
```  
![Boxplot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nsh87/hs616/master/figs/boxplot.png)  
What do the box and whisker represent in the plot? 

* The interquartile range (the middle half of the data set), and the median of 
the data, respectively
 *  The most common values in the data set, and the median of the data,
respectively
 *  The interquartile range (the middle half of the data set), and the mean of the
data, respectively
 *  The middle 25% of the data, and the median of the data, respectively

## Lecture 10a

Shiny apps for R are good for: 

* All of these
 *  Exploratory data analysis
 *  Embedding interactions into R Presentations
 *  Sharing data sets with others on the web

## Lecture 10b

Shiny apps have a number of widgets available to change parameters in functions
and plots. When adjusting, for example, the Slider Input while running a Shiny
app, the rest of the data will update... 

* immediately
 *  only after you refresh the page
 *  only if the developer updates the app
 *  never

## Lecture 11a

![Hierarchical Clustering](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nsh87/hs616/master/figs/hierarchical-clustering.png)  
The type of clustering shown above is called... 

* hierarchical clustering
 *  density clustering
 *  K-means clustering
 *  relationship clustering

## Lecture 11b

K-means clustering attempts to minimize... 

* the within sum of squares value of each cluster
 *  the between sum of squares value
 *  the number of points in each cluster
 *  the randomness of cluster assignment

## Lecture 12a

Linear regression attempts to minimize the sum of squares error between the
vertical distances of points and the fitted line. What is the plot below
showing?  
![Sum of Squares Error Plot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nsh87/hs616/master/figs/sum-of-squares-error-visual.png) 

* How the error between the fitted line and points is measured
 *  A random quadratic equation plotting against some random points
 *  A poorly fit linear equation
 *  None of these answers is correct

## Lecture 12b

What is the name of a common function in R that fits linear models? 

* `lm()`
 *  `lin()`
 *  'linfit()`
 *  `fit()`

## Lecture 13a

Linear regression treats the input variables as... 

* numerical values
 *  boolean
 *  categories
 *  continuous densities

## Lecture 13b

Which function included in R can be used to perform logistic regression? 

* `glm()`
 *  `lm()`
 *  `fit()`
 *  `logit()`

## Lecture 14a

![ROC](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nsh87/hs616/master/figs/auc.png)  
ROC curves, such as the one shown above, are a common tool used to...   

* evaluate the performance of machine learning models
 *  evaluate the fit of a linear model
 *  plot points of a data set against predictions
 *  strike fear into the hearts of men

## Lecture 14b

What can be said about the following learning curve?  
![Learning Curve](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nsh87/hs616/master/figs/learning-curve.png)   

* Adding additional points to the training data _will not_ help improve the model
 *  Adding additional points to the training data _will_ help improve the model
 *  The model is over-fitted
 *  The model is under-fitted
