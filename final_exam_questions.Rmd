## Lecture 8a

What should you be aware of when using the rainbow colormap with plots?

* All of these
* After the ROYGBIV colors are exhausted the colors will start repeating
* Certain colors, such as yellow, are hard to distinguish on some screens
* Our eyes tend to focus on colors that "pop", potentially biasing our
interpretation of the plot

## Lecture 8b

A scree plot displays eigenvalues associated with components or factors and can
help determine the number of factors that display most of the varaiability in a
given data set. Using the scree plot below, what is the ideal number of factors
for PCA from this data set?

* 2
* 1
* 3
* 40

## Lecture 9b

You create the plot below.  
![High Density Plot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nsh87/hs616/master/figs/high-density-plot.png)  
Realizing this display format does not tell you much about the data, you plot
the same data, this time creating the new plot below.  
![Smooth Scatter Plot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nsh87/hs616/master/figs/smoothscatter-of-high-density-plot.png)  
What can be said about this new plot?

* It is a smooth scatter, or density plot, useful when a data set displays
overplotting
* It is a blurred scatter, useful when a data set displays overplotting
* It not considered a scatter or density plot at all
* It requires a special package in R to produce

## Lecture 9b

The following code generates the plot below:  
```R
g2 + geom_boxplot() + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=50, size=20, vjust=0.5))
```  
![Boxplot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nsh87/hs616/master/figs/boxplot.png)  
What do the box and whisker represent in the plot?

* The interquartile range (the middle half of the data set), and the median of 
the data, respectively
* The most common values in the data set, and the median of the data,
respectively
* The interquartile range (the middle half of the data set), and the mean of the
data
* The middle 25% of the data, and the median of the data, respectively
