##### Background #####

This simulated data set is based on the journal article "Is More Better? The
Relationship between Nurse Staffing and the Quality of Nursing Care in
Hospitals" in Medical Care. In this study author, Julie Sochalski 
(PhD, RN, FAAN), analyzed data obtained from a 1999 survey of 8,670 inpatient
nurses from Pennsylvania, U.S.A hospitals. In this survey, nurses were asked
to rate the quality of care from their last shift and estimate the number
of patients they cared for, the number of tasks that went undone, and the
number of patient safety problems that occurred during the same shift. The
author found several correlations between the nurses' responses. The
questions asked in this survey and the values (such as means and STD) are the
inspiration for this simulated data set.

staffing and the quality of nursing care in hospitals. Medical care, 42(2),
II-67.

Here, we simulate responses to the same questions as were in that 1999 survey.
These responses are entered into a hospital administrative system over
several years by its nurses in an effort to better understand what the
hospital can do to imporove patient care. The hospital has no knowledge
of what factors correlate with patient care and is hoping to use the data
obtained to discover relationships between the various response that will
help them improve patient care.
